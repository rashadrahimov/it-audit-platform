# Layer 1 of docs/DELIVERY-ARCHITECTURE.md, as a script rather than a promise.
#
# The agent review of the pull request that introduced this architecture made
# the point that killed the previous design: a replacement control that is only
# described is not a control. So the enforcement lives here, is version
# controlled, is re-runnable, and is what every other repository copies.
#
# What it configures on `main`:
#   - changes arrive only through a pull request (no direct push, no force push,
#     no branch deletion)
#   - `agent-review` must be green before merge
#   - no required approvals: the owner works alone, and a rule nobody can
#     satisfy is how production became undeployable in the first place
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/ci/configure-main-protection.sh [owner/repo]
